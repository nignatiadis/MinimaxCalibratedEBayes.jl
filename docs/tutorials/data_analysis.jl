# # Prostate data analysis

# ## Preliminaries
 
# Let us make some analysis choices from the beginning 

# ### Empirical Bayes Targets
# Our goal is to estimate the Posterior mean and the local false sign rates:

target_grid = -3:0.2:3
post_means = PosteriorMean.(StandardNormalSample.(target_grid))
lfsrs =  LFSR.(StandardNormalSample.(target_grid));

# ### Empirical Bayes Prior Class
# For the prior class we consider a mixture of Gaussians
# that have standard deviation $0.2$ and with mixing measure
# supported on $[-3,3]$. Note that we also specify the solver 
# to be used for solving the convex programming problems;
# here we use Mosek.
gcal = GaussianMixturePriorClass(0.2, -3:0.02:3, Mosek.Optimizer, ["QUIET" =>true])

# ### Discretization of marginal observations 
marginal_grid = -4:0.02:4



# ## Load the data

# The dataset is from the following reference:
#   >Dinesh Singh, Phillip G. Febbo, Kenneth Ross, Donald G. Jackson, Judith Manola, Christine Ladd, Pablo Tamayo, Andrew A. Renshaw, Anthony V. D’Amico, Jerome P. Richie, Eric S. Lander, Massimo Loda, Philip W. Kantoff, Todd R. Golub, and William R. Sellers. Gene expression correlates of clinical prostate cancer behavior. Cancer cell, 1(2): 203–209, 2002.

# See the following monograph for further illustration of empirical Bayes methods on this dataset
#   >Bradley Efron. Large-scale inference: Empirical Bayes methods for estimation, testing, and prediction. Cambridge University Press, 2012.
prostz_file = MinimaxCalibratedEBayes.prostate_data_file
R"load($prostz_file)"
@rget prostz;
Zs = StandardNormalSample.(prostz);

# We will implement the preprocessing steps manually here.
# Afterwards, we will use wrapper that automates all of these steps.

# First we split our data into two folds
Random.seed!(200)
Zs_train, Zs_test, _, _ = MCEB._split_data(Zs);

# Let us quickly check the range of values in the folds
extrema(response(Zs_train)), extrema(response(Zs_test))

# Now we use the first fold to estimate an $L_\infty$ neighborhood
# of the marginal density. We also fit a logspline model of the
# prior density to get our pilot estimators.

# ### Neighborhood construction:

infinity_band_options = KDEInfinityBandOptions(a_min=-4.0, a_max=4.0);
fkde_train = fit(infinity_band_options, response.(Zs_train));

# Let us visualize the result by showing a histogram of the datapoints
# the estimated density function and the $L_\infty$ bands.

          label="", alpha=0.4, fillcolor=:lightgray)
plot!(prostate_marginal_plot, fkde_train, fillalpha=0.45, #L"\bar{f}(x)\pm c_m",
      linewidth=1, label=nothing, #L"\bar{f}(x)\pm c_m",
	  legend=:topleft,  bg_legend=:transparent, 
	  fg_legend=:transparent)

# ### G-model fitting


# We choose the following class 
exp_family = ContinuousExponentialFamilyModel(Uniform(-3.6,3.6),
                         collect(-3.6:0.1:3.6); df=5, scale=true);	 
exp_family_solver = MCEB.ExponentialFamilyDeconvolutionMLE(cefm = exp_family, c0=0.001);

# Let us fit to the training data		 
exp_family_fit = fit(exp_family_solver, Zs_train);

# Let us look at the pilot estimates we got
lfsr_logspline_estimate = estimate.(lfsrs , exp_family_fit)
post_mean_logspline_estimate = estimate.(post_means , exp_family_fit);
#src expfamily_fits_plot = plot(plot(target_grid, lfsr_logspline_estimate),
#src                           plot(target_grid, post_mean_logspline_estimate),
#src						   label="")

# ### Implement discretization

# Discretize our test samples to implement minimax calibration methodology
Zs_test_discr = DiscretizedStandardNormalSamples(Zs_test, marginal_grid);
# Set the $L_{\infty}$ band we computed earlier.
Zs_test_discr = set_neighborhood(Zs_test_discr, fkde_train);

# ### Put everything together
# We put all of the above in one struct that will be used in the final step
# of confidence interval construction

# We set `cache_target=true` to speed up computations for the tutorial, cf.
# Appendix C.3.5 of the manuscript for an explanation.

# # The impact of Neighborhoods: Moving to opportunity

# We next seek to repeat the analysis in the second dataset. Here we will also
# see how most of the steps manually conducted for the prostate dataset
# can be automated.
